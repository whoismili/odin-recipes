    <p><em>Chicken Tots ready to be served</em></p>

    <p>These chicken tots have a poutine vibe, and, while being much easier and faster to make than real poutine, satisfies in the same way. 
    <p>Saucy meat over potatoes is always a winner, but this creamy chicken sauce over tots will be your new favorite thing the minute you try it.

        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>1 cup diced sweet bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic. minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>       
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>        
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>        
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>        
        <li>1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with foil, and spray with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place tater tots on the prepared sheet pan, and spray tots lightly with vegetable oil. 
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until nicely browned on the bottoms and edges, about 30 minutes. Keep warm in the oven until needed.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for chicken, season chicken thighs on both sides with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat, and cook chicken just until no longer pink at the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove to a plate to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, cut chicken into 1/2-inch pieces.</li>
        <li>Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno peppers to the skillet, and saut√© over medium-high heat until edges start to brown and onions turn translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add sliced green onions and lemon zest, and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Add lemon juice, chicken broth, and any accumulated juices from the plate, and cook, stirring, until liquids reduce by about half, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cream, and bring back to a simmer. Stir in chicken, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until chicken is heated through and cream sauce thickens to desired texture, about 5 minutes more..</li>
        <li>Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve over hot tots.</li>
    </ol>
