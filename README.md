### [The Odin Project - mili @ odin-recipes](www.theodinproject.com)

This current project is a plain web page about recipes, made based on the instructions found along the tutorial. Following the steps as close as I could was my target. Also, using my past experience, I've tried to beautify the project, but also keep it clean and in the bounds of the tutorial. 

Until now I have learned about 

 - creating lists
 - adding links
 - adding images
 - doing correctly a commit on Github (*still working on this one, haha*)


### Note made on 17.01.2025
I am looking forward to improve myself, get better and better as days are passing and develop my logical thinking through the course. Building an entire React website is my goal and I will not stop until I reach it.
